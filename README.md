## VSTs
**Some of these make you make an account, if you want I can just send you the VST to make that less annoying**

**Rough Guide for installing VSTs**
1. Prefer VST3 and always do 64 bit - 32 bit just doesn't work on modern Windows
2. Make sure they all install to `C:\Program Files\Common Files\<VST2 or VST3>` depending on whether it's a VST2 or VST3
